## ‚å®Ô∏è How to Use

### Import theme

1. Download `Panda-Theme-Cmder.xml`
2. Open cmder.exe and click on cmder icon on title bar after this click on `Settings` or press <kbd>win + alt + p</kbd>
3. In bottom of settings window click `Import...` button and choose `Panda-Theme-Cmder.xml`
4. Confirm changes and click on `Save settings`.

### Add the theme without losing other settings

If you changed other settings in Cmder and want to keep them, you can add the theme without overwriting all your changes.

1. Download `Panda-Theme-Cmder-Palette.xml`
2. Open the settings file `ConEmu.xml`
3. Find the palette definition under the `Colors` tag. It should look similar to this:

   ```
   <key name="Palette1" modified="2020-05-04 13:23:05" build="191012">
		<value name="Name" type="string" data="Theme Name"/>
		...
	</key>
   ``` 

   If you don't have the definition, then you may not have a custom color scheme. To add one, open Cmder and go to the settings and navigate to the `Colors` subsection of `Features`. Under `Schemes`, enter a "Panda Theme" and click "Save". Confirm the changes and then close out of Cmder.

4. Copy the contents of `Panda-Theme-Cmder-Palette.xml` and save `ConEmu.xml`
5. Open Cmder and go to the settings
6. Click on the "General" section in the left pane
7. Under "Choose color scheme", select "Panda Theme"
8. Click on "Save settings"

### Manually change the color scheme

You can manually change the colors without the `ConEmu.xml` file

1. Open cmder.exe and click on cmder icon on title bar after this click on `Settings` or press <kbd>win + alt + p</kbd>
2. Go to `Colors` sub of `Features` setting and change standard colors to colors of this image:
